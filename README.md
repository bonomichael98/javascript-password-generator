# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This project is an automatic javascript password generator. 

## 01 How It Works

The password generator listens for a button click, when the button is pressed it signals multiple prompts to start that request inputs. The inputs are then fed into a variable that holds the inputs. The variable is then fed into a randomization function that receives the length of the input to randomly generate a password based on the submitted criteria. The password is then displayed to the page.
